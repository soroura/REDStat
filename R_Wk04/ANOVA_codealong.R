# NULL HYPOTHESIS: Working status doesn't affect the number of hours of sleep per night

summary(NHANES) # to see descriptive statistics of all variables

# We will keep only adults (aged 18 and over)

# Perform the ANOVA

# This doesnâ€™t give any output, for that you need to use the summary() function.

# There is one row for the Work variable, which shows the among group information,

# For each row, there is the number of degrees of freedom, the sum of squares,

# For the Work variable (treatment, or explanatory variable), there is also 
# the F-value and the associated p-value.
# Here the df for Work is 3 (Work categories) - 1 = 2
# df for the residuals = 7354 observations - Work categories = 7351
# Work Sum of squares = differences among Work categories
# Residual Sum of squares = variation within Work categories
# Mean Square = SS / df
# F = MS among / MS within = 48.99 / 1.77

# hours of sleep at night

# Compare means among Work categories
anova1_emmeans <- emmeans(ANOVA1,"Work")
anova1_emmeans

# ASSUMPTIONS
# 1) Independent data
# 2) Normality
# 3) Homogeneity of variance

# 1) Independent data

# As we've seen before, each row of the NHANES dataset should be a 
# different individual, therefore the assumption of independence is met.

# 2) Normality

# Histogram
dataset1 %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = SleepHrsNight)) +
  geom_histogram(bins = 10) +
  facet_wrap(facets = ~Work, ncol = 1, scales = "free_y")

# Q-Q plot to assess normal distribution of SleepHrsNight
ggplot(dataset1, aes(sample = SleepHrsNight)) +
  stat_qq() + # this line plots the error terms
  stat_qq_line() # this line plots the regression line
# The histograms and Q-Q plot suggest that SleepHrsNight comes from a normal
# distribution.

# Shapiro-Wilk normality test
# shapiro.test(dataset1$SleepHrsNight)
# The error message says we can't have more than 5000 observations.

# We create a random sample of dataset1 with just 4000 observations.
sample <- slice_sample(dataset1, n = 4000)
shapiro.test(sample$SleepHrsNight)
# Significant departure from normality, maybe due to large sample.

# 3) Homogeneity of variance

# Boxplot as before
dataset1 %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = Work, y = SleepHrsNight, fill = Work)) +
  geom_boxplot() +
  labs(title = "Figure 1: Boxplot of Hours of Sleep by Work situation") 

# The boxplots suggest that there is equal variance  of
# SleepHrsNight between Work categories
# Can also use Bartlett's test of homogeneity of variances
# H0: variances are equal across groups
bartlett.test(dataset1$SleepHrsNight~dataset1$Work)
# Or Levene's test if the variable is not normally distributed
# Levene's test with one independent variable
leveneTest(SleepHrsNight ~ Work, data = dataset1)

## BONUS PLOT
## Residual plot to see if the residuals are similarly distributed across groups.

# Create a tibble with the fitted values, residuals and Work category
Model <- tibble(Fitted = fitted(ANOVA1), # extracts fitted values from ANOVA1
                Residuals = resid(ANOVA1), # extracts residuals from ANOVA1
                Work = dataset1$Work) # takes the Work categories from dataset1

# Create a residual plot for the ANOVA model, which shows the residuals for 
# each Work category The residuals on the y-axis are the differences between 
# the actual data points and the fitted values. The fitted values on the x-axis
# are the means for each treatment. We expect residuals to have a mean of 0 if
# there is a symmetric distribution of SleepHrsNight for each Work category.
# The residuals shouldn't show any pattern and be roughly evenly distributed 
# above and below 0.
